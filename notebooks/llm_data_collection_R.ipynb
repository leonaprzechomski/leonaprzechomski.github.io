I will check this planning at the start of the day and in-between tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 2 | 1 | 5.9 |\n| request_8  | PROMPT: Set an academic goal for the upcoming week.\nANSWER: I want to get my motivation back to study\nPROMPT: Add details to make your goal more specific.\nANSWER: Be happier while studying, focusing on the reason again why I chose this study, feeling enthusiastic and motivated when I have to study, be more efficient in planning, be more assertive during classes and contacting supervisors, feeling more relaxed while studying and less stressed out\nPROMPT: How will you measure progress on and acheivement of your goal?\nANSWER: Measure by subjective feelings, so how am I feeling that day when studying? Also measure by productivity, how much can I get done in that period of time and is that different from before? Measure by the amount of work Im planning each week on my studies. But I dont know how to get more assertive\nPROMPT: Why is this goal important to you in the context of your prior experiences and future goals?\nANSWER: Because studying has always been an important part of my life for me and because I wanted to keep studying I feel the pressure of succeeding. Right now Im not enjoying my study like I used to and am just looking forward to my master (if I find an internship) so I can go to work. But learning will always be an important part of my work so I need to be motivated to go back to school and keep up with scientific literature. If I want to do healthcare psychology I need to keep this pace up.\nPROMPT: Create a step-by-step plan for achieving this goal in the coming week.\nANSWER: - Planning my studyhours everyday before studying \n- Planning a period of time in the morning to set up my studywork, making a plan on how to work on my studyload that day \n- Do the work \n- Take regular breaks, every 50 minutes. Use 10 minutes to relax, read, play a game, watch Netflix for a bit \n- At the end of the studyblock, write down any feelings about how it went \n- Reflect on the amount of work done \n- Reflect on the planning this week overall | 0 | 0 | 7.6 |\n| request_9  | PROMPT: Set an academic goal for the upcoming week.\nANSWER: I would like to keep on track with the readings I have to do\nPROMPT: Add details to make your goal more specific.\nANSWER: Every week we have two tutorials, which are smaller groups, where we have a debate about the readings we have done before. Each week for both of them we have more than 100 pages to read and we need to arrive prepared at the tutorial. So I would like to manage better my time in order to arrive prepared at every tutorial with all the readings well done\nPROMPT: How will you measure progress on and acheivement of your goal?\nANSWER: I can decide how many pages I have to study each day\nPROMPT: Why is this goal important to you in the context of your prior experiences and future goals?\nANSWER: I think is good because it will help me in manage my time better, but also i will have more time for myself, for working, hanging out with friends. I also think is fundamental to learn how to manage many things all together at the same time now at university, because later on it will be even worse\nPROMPT: Create a step-by-step plan for achieving this goal in the coming week.\nANSWER: At first I will count all the pages i have to do, so that i know exactly how much work is, after I will take the calendar and i will divide the work for every day, writing precisely how many pages i should do each day. After that, every day i will try to stick to the plan as much as possible and maybe to motivate myself, I will decide a reward that I can have just if i manage to do everything that was written in the plan of the day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 1 | 1 | 7.6 |\n| request_10 | PROMPT: Set an academic goal for the upcoming week.\nANSWER: Reading all the literature given\nPROMPT: Add details to make your goal more specific.\nANSWER: Each week I am given 8 articles to read. We cover 2 topics and half the articles about the first topic and half are about the second topic. Usually I am not able to finish reading all of the articles before the class while it is necessary to be able to participate well. So Id like to read all the articles before class.\nPROMPT: How will you measure progress on and acheivement of your goal?\nANSWER: Count how many articles I read before class.\nPROMPT: Why is this goal important to you in the context of your prior experiences and future goals?\nANSWER: By completing this goal, I will be better set up for passing the course exam.\nPROMPT: Create a step-by-step plan for achieving this goal in the coming week.\nANSWER: 1: make a schedule of the days I will read each article\n2: make sure there are no distractions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2 | 2 | 7.0 |\n\n",

Also measure by productivity, how much can I get done in that period of time and is that different from before? Measure by the amount of work Im planning each week on my studies. But I dont know how to get more assertive\nPROMPT: Why is this goal important to you in the context of your prior experiences and future goals?\nANSWER: Because studying has always been an important part of my life for me and because I wanted to keep studying I feel the pressure of succeeding. Right now Im not enjoying my study like I used to and am just looking forward to my master (if I find an internship) so I can go to work. But learning will always be an important part of my work so I need to be motivated to go back to school and keep up with scientific literature.

I also think is fundamental to learn how to manage many things all together at the same time now at university, because later on it will be even worse\nPROMPT: Create a step-by-step plan for achieving this goal in the coming week.\nANSWER: At first I will count all the pages i have to do, so that i know exactly how much work is, after I will take the calendar and i will divide the work for every day, writing precisely how many pages i should do each day. After that, every day i will try to stick to the plan as much as possible and maybe to motivate myself, I will decide a reward that I can have just if i manage to do everything that was written in the plan of the day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & 1 & 1 & 7.6\\\\\n\t request\\_10 & PROMPT: Set an academic goal for the upcoming week.\nANSWER: Reading all the literature given\nPROMPT: Add details to make your goal more specific.\nANSWER: Each week I am given 8 articles to read.
