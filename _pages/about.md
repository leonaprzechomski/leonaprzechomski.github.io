I am a Sociology PhD Student at University of Cologne. My research focuses on migration and discrimination. I am also interested in how COVID changed our society. I currently hold the [CGS Scholarship](https://cgs.uni-koeln.de/en/funding/cgs-scholarships) and work at the Chair of [Eldad Davidov](https://iss-wiso.uni-koeln.de/de/institut/personen-a-z/d/prof-dr-eldad-davidov).
